        <h2>It all began on ...</h2>
        <p class="text-from-history">
            The first week of 2020 pandemic.
            I had just joined my university and all of the suddenly the world have stopped.
            For me, personally, I haven't watched a single class after 2 years preparing.
            In contrast, during the process of adaptation to remote classes, and etc,
            I've discovered the power of coding by solve problems. At first, I was a little
            intimidated for not wholly understanding the course first course that I've found on
            the web, CS50x from Harvard University. But I've buckle up and started
            grasping some lines
            here and there ...
        </p>
        <p>
            After a couple of weeks, developing the problems,
            discovering the powerful usage of the terminal, logical thinking, and understanding
            how to transfer one idea to a working program have been challenging, but definitely fulfilling.
            During this time, I've enrolled in quite a few programming languages, hackathons,
            and several open-source projects/tools.
